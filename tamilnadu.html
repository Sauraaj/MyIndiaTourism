            <h2>History</h2>
            <i>
                Tamil Nadu was ruled by three major dynasties-the Cholas in the east, the Pandyas in the central area and Cheras in the west. This was during the Sangam Age - the classical period of Tamil literature-that continued for some 300 years after the birth of Christ. The Pallava dynasty was influential particularly in the 7th and 8th centuries, testimonies to which are the monuments at Mamallapuram. In the 13th century, with threats of Muslim invasions from the north, the southern Hindu dynasties combined and the empire of Vijayanagar, which covered all of South India, was firmly established. However, by the 17th century, due to the disintegration of the Vijayanagar Empire, various small rulers like the Nayaks ruled southern India. By the middle of the 18th century, there were frequent conflicts between the British, French, Danes, and Dutch due to their interest in these areas. The British were finally victorious, while small pockets like Pondicherry and Karaikal remained under French control. Under the British rule, most of south India was integrated into the region called the Madras Presidency. In 1956, the Madras Presidency was disbanded and Tamil Nadu was established.
                
                Inspite of various invasions in India from the northern part, Tamil Nadu remained relatively unaffected by the turmoils of the early history of northern India. First, the Muslim invaders and later, the Mughals seldom tried to capture the South. Later several dynasties like the Pallavas,Pandyas and Cholas encouraged the growth of classical music, dance, sculpture and art, all of which attained the supreme level of excellency. The Pallavas made their capital at Kanchipuram, the cholas ruled from Tanjore and the Pandyas ruled from Madurai. Karnataka and some parts of Tamil Nadu were ruled by the Chalukyas who brought the temple art of the South to the pinnacle of its glory. Even, the British influence was marginal, the early Europeans set their foot first on the soil of Tamil Nadu. With the arrival of the British East India Company in the mid 17th century at Madras, the Tamil Nadu began to acquire a colonial legacy which can be seen in the city of Madras and in the beautiful hill resorts in the interior of the state.

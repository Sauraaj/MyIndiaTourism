            <p>Manipur, a little Shangrila located in North-East India, is a Jewel of India. This little corner is a paradise on Earth where Mother Nature has been extra generous in her bounty. Least touched and least discovered Manipur promises to be the great tourist discovery of the 21st century.
            An oval shaped valley surrounded by blue green hills, rich in art and tradition has inspired description such as the “Switzerland of the East” with its cascading rapids, tripling rivers, varieties of flowers, exotic blooms and lakes. The people of Manipur include Meitei, Nagas, Kuki-Chin-Mizo and Gorkhas groups and Muslims and other colourful communities which have lived in complete harmony for centuries.
            These are the people whose folklore, myths and legends, dances, indigenous games and martial arts, exotic handlooms and handicrafts are invested with the mystique of nature and an indefatigable “Joie de vivre”.     

            The Department of Tourism, Government of Manipur  came in to existence in August, 1972 as a publicity wing of the IPR Department.  Over the years it has evolved into an independent department, considering the natural beauty and potential of the State, every effort should be taken to make it an efficient and vital department of Tourism in the State</p>
            
            <h1>History</h1>
            <i>
            Manipur history reflects the rich and ancient history the region boasts of. Ruled by more than hundred kings over the years, the ancient history of Manipur goes back to 33 A.D. Not only the region was ruled by different kings in different times, it was called by various names from time to time.
                The first famous king of Manipur was Pakhangba who ruled during 33 A.D. Maharaja Bhagyachandra, who ruled during the 18th Century, rose with same valor and fought against the Burmese to protect his land. He is the person behind the popularity of Vaishnavism in Manipur.

Manipur came under the British rule in 1891 when they defeated the Burmese. Manipur has witnessed many battles during the World War II. The Indian National Army led by the great Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose marched towards Imphal before they were defeated by allied forces.

Once an independent kingdom, Manipur was declared free once more in 1947. However, the then king of Manipur - Budhachandra signed an agreement under which the state became a part of the Indian Dominion. In the year 1972, it became the state we know today.

            <p>It is the 10th largest state in India, with an area of 135,194 km2 (52,199 sq mi). With a population of 28 million, Chhattisgarh is the 17th most-populated state in the country. 
            The state was formed on 1 November 2000 by partitioning 16 Chhattisgarhi-speaking southeastern districts of Madhya P0radesh
            The country’s most densely (44%) forested state is blessed with considerable natural beauty – waterfalls and unspoilt nature reserves abound
                
                Chhattisgarh is a heavily forested state in central India known for its temples and waterfalls. Near the capital Raipur, the town of Sirpur on the Mahanadi River is home to the red-brick Lakshmana (Laxman) Temple, decorated with carvings from Indian mythology. In the south, the city of Jagdalpur hosts the Sanjay Market on Sundays, a bartering place for local tribes. The huge Chitrakoot Falls lie to the northwest.

Chhattisgarh is presently one of the few states that have surplus power. Korba district in Chhattisgarh is known as the power capital of India. 

Chhattisgarh also has the largest concentration of Schedule Tribes in the country.

Its cities, especially Raipur are full of migrants from other parts of the country.

The state has tropical climate with hot summer and cold winters. Most of the precipitation occurs during the monsoon (July to mid-September). Day temperature during the summers (mid-April to June end) can touch a high of around 45�C while in the winters the temperature may fall well below 10�C.

            <h2>History</h2>
            
            <p>A major part of the Chhattisgarh as we know today was known as Dandakaranya in the ancient times. Other parts were known as Dakshina Koshal. In the medieval period, the region, which falls south of the Vindhyas, came to be known as Gondwana.

Earliest human settlements were established in this region much before they came into existence in any other part of the country. Historians and anthropologists are trying to establish the exact date for the earliest human settlement in this region.

Right from the beginning, Chhattisgarh has been swarmed with migrants from nearby places, who now constitute a major part of the population. Right from the days of great Magadha Empire, Chhattisgarh remained part of every empire that ruled the country from north to south, but their dominance was political only.

As the region was extremely inaccessible, not much interference could be made in the lifestyle of the tribes. Kalchuris were the first rulers who ruled clearly over this region till 19th century. After the fall of Kalchuris, it was time for the Bhonsles of Nagpur to dominate over this region for a brief period in the 19th century. However with the decline of the Marathas, there prevailed complete lawlessness throughout the region and many tribal chieftains established rule over small tracts of land.

The English recognized the mineral wealth of the region and established a vast network of mines and railway track throughout the region, which marked the beginning of a new phase in the tribal history of Chhattisgarh.

Today, the state is a heterogeneous mix of races from all over the country working together to create a prosperous Chhattisgarh.

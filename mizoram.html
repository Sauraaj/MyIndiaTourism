            Mizoram is one of the seven sisters of Northeast India, bordered by Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) to its east and south, Bangladesh to its west, and the states of Manipur, Assam, and Tripura to its north. 

            Mizoram means 'Land of the Highlanders' and its local language is Mizo. The Mizo Hills, which dominate the state's topography, rise to more than 2000 m (6560 ft) near the Myanmar border. Aizawl, the state capital, is 1220 m (4000 ft) above sea level.

            An amalgam of the former North and South Lushai Hill districts, Mizoram is a land of great natural beauty, an endless variety of landscape with rich flora and fauna, clusters of whispering pines and quaint villages with houses on stilts.

            The Tropic of Cancer runs through the heart of Mizoram, and hence, it has a pleasantly temperate climate throughout the year. A land of steep hills and deep gorges, Mizoram's highest peak 'The Blue Mountain' rises to a height of 2165 metres. Important rivers that flow through this hilly state are Tlawang, Sonai, Tuivawl, Kolodine and Kamaphuli.

            <h1>History</h1>
            <i>
            Like the adjacent states in north East India, there exist many theories about origin of the Mizos. The folklores are still prevalent among the tribes but most historians agree that the ancestors of tribes inhabiting the state presently, hailed from China. They came into Indian territories as part of a great Mongoloid migration which took place from 16th to 18th century.

                The first waves of Mongoloid tribes coming to Indian territories from China were called Kukis. They were followed later by New Kukis and Lushai tribes respectively. In the 18th and 9th century the tribes staying in present day Mizoram were engaged in rounds of raids and endeavor to mark territories. After the British rule, the area was named as Lushai Hills district. This also marked conversion of the tribes into Christianity.

                Post independence, Mizoram was made a part of Assam. The tribes formed Mizo National Front in 1961 and movement gained momentum in subsequent years to make the region a union territory and state. It was made a union territory in 1972. Finally after a long reign of armed struggle for statehood and sovereignty, Mizoram gained statehood in 1986.

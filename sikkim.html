            Sikkim is one of the most beautiful states in India. It is a landlocked state, meaning it's surrounded almost entirely by land. It is also the least populous state in the country, with most of its inhabitants being Nepali. Despite being the second smallest state, it boasts of being one of the most geographically diverse regions in the country. Sikkim is bordered by Nepal, China, Bhutan and West Bengal. About 40% of the total area of Sikkim are covered with forests, making it the best getaway for nature lovers.

            <h1>History</h1>
            <i>
            ikkim was derived from two Limbu words: su which means new and khyim which means palace or even house. Su khyim or new palace is believed to have been a reference to Phuntsog Namgyal's palace at that time. 

                Tibetans also have a different name for Sikkim, Drenjong which means valley of rice. The Bhutias (Tibetan origin) call the region Beyul Demazong which means the hidden valley of rice. The original inhabitants of Sikkim, called the Lepchas, also has a different name for Sikkim. They call it Nye Mae El which means paradise.

                During the pre-historic times, Sikkim was inhabited by three major tribes, namely: Naong, Chang and Mon. A bit later, the Lepchas came to the region. Their exact origin was unknown, some believe that they came from the South of the Brahmaputra Valley. Others believe that they came from Tibet or Burma. However, the Lepchas believe that they are indigenous to the region.

                With the conflict in Tibet, many red hat Tibetans migrated to Sikkim. These are now known as the Bhutias who occupied the lands in Sikkim not occupied by the Lepchas. They also converted some Lepchas into Buddhists but for the most part, the Lepchas remained aloof. The Bhutias also chose Phuntsok Namgyal as their king during this time and his monarchy reigned for a long time.

                During the 13th century, Guru Tashi of the Minzang dynasty in Tibet had a vision that he should go to Drenjong. So he did go, together with his family and they came upon the temple being built by the Sakya king. The workers were unable to lift the pillar for the temple. So Guru Tashi's eldest son single-handedly raised the pillar and he came to be known as Khye Bumsa, which means the superior of a thousand heroes.
                During the 1780's, Tenzing Namgyal succeeded the throne but it was also the time that the Nepali ensued wars upon the region. The Nepali were successful in conquering some of the lands in Sikkim. The Chinese intervened and finally, the Nepali were defeated. In 1793, Tsudphud Namgyal succeeded the throne.

                The Nepali continued their expansion of the lands in Sikkim. With the help of the British, they were completely defeated by 1816 and the Treaty of Titalia gave back these seized lands to Sikkim. The region of Darjeeling was gifted to the British with an agreement that an annual subsidy would be given to the Sikkim rulers.

                When India became independent during the year 1947, the then ruler of Sikkim, Tashi Namgyal, gained a special status of protectorate from the government. When he died in 1963, his son succeeded the throne. However, this was met by resistances and in 1975, the Chogyal dynasty was abolished to give way for the election of the second chief minister of Sikkim, Nar Bahadur Bandari.

            Tripura is a hilly state in northeast India, bordered on 3 sides by Bangladesh, and home to a diverse mix of tribal cultures and religious groups. In the capital Agartala, the imposing Ujjayanta Palace is set among Mughal gardens, and Gedu Mia’s Mosque has white marble domes and towers. South of the city, Neermahal summer palace sits in the middle of Lake Rudrasagar and blends Hindu and Islamic architectural styles.
                
                Tripura is one of the Northeastern seven sister states in India. In fact, it is the 3rd smallest state of India and covers an area of 10,486 square km.  The state is surrounded by Bangladesh on its north, west and south. On its eastern side, it is surrounded by the state of Mizoram and Assam. Agartala is the capital of this state. As per the 2011 census, the population of the state is 36,73,032. It constitutes around 0.3% of the total population of the country. The indigenous communities that are known as ST (Scheduled Tribes) in India form 30% of the population in Tripura. The state has 19 tribes, and it is an eco-friendly and pollution-free state.

The languages that are mainly spoken in this state are Kokborok and Bangla. This state was ruled by the Tripuri dynasty for many centuries. It was considered as a princely state at the time of the British rule. In the year 1949, it became a part of independent India. The ethnic strife and conflict between the Bengali population and indigenous people have led to scattered violence and tension since the integration of this state in India. On the other hand, the institution of an independent tribal administrative organisation and various strategies have calmed the situation. National Highway 44 is the only main highway that connects this state with the rest of India.
                
                Tripura, located on the extreme corner of the Indian subcontinent, Tripura has Bangladesh as its border on its north, west and south. Assam and Mizoram border the eastern part of the state. Tripura was always a princely state ruled by a Maharaja until the time of independence and never came under British supervision. This meant that it did not become ‘fashionable’ as a winter resort like Shillong (in Meghalaya) and Shimla (in Himachal Pradesh) became. Yet, this tiny state - the smallest in terms of area, claim to a variety of attractions in terms of archeological importance, religious significance, folk and tribal culture and ethnic artifacts.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <i>
             The history of the region is mentioned in epic Mahabharata. It was ruled by the Manikya dynasty from the 14th century. The Manikyas, who supposedly belonged to the Indo-Mongolian group, ruled over this area independently even at the time when most parts of the Indian subcontinent were under British rule. The rulers of the state had a good relation with the British during that time and the later helped Tripura to protect itself from the Nawabs of Bengal to take over the state. After the independence of India, an agreement to merge Tripura with the Indian Union was signed by the Regent Maharani on September 9, 1947. This state became a union territory of the country without legislature from November 1, 1956 and a ministry was formed on July 1, 1963. On January 21, 1972, Tripura got its statehood. Accessing Tripura was difficult until when Maharaja Bir Bikram made an airport in Agartala. Rabindranath Tagore is said to have had a very deep touch with this state. The two famous novels by the Nobel laureate, namely, the Visarjan and Rajasri were based on the legends of the Manikyas.

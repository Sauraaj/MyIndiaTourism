            <h1>  History</h1>
            <i>
                Andhra Pradesh’s history dates back to the Vedic period. The earliest mention of the Andhras was mentioned in the Aitareya Brahmana and it was called Dakshina Pandit during those days.

There is evidence that the coastal kingdom of Andhra Pradesh was quite flourishing during the Satavahanas Period and around the Mauryan age, there is evidence that Andhra was a political power.

After the fall of the Satavahana Empire, Andhra was left in a political turmoil. After the disintegration of the empire, the Ikshvakus of Nagarjunakonda came into power. There is proof that under this empire Buddhism had flourished.

Andhra was also under the control of the Kakatiya Dynasty, the Reddy Dynasty, Vijaynagar Empire and the Mughal rule. At the start of the colonial era, there was a major war between the English and French at Chandurthi in 1758, during which the latter was defeated by the British army and Maharaja Ananda Gajapathi Raju of Vizianagram. In 1792, the British took over this area after defeating the Maharaja.

Post independence, the Nizam of Hyderabad wanted independence from India, but he was forced to be a part of India in 1948. In 1953, the States Reorganization Commission was appointed to create Andhra Pradesh on linguistic lines.

Andhra state was merged with the Telugu speaking area of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh was created in 1965.</i>

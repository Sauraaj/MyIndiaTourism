            <p>Bihar is located in the eastern part of the countryIt is the 13th-largest state of India, with an area of 94,163 km2 (36,357 sq mi). The third-largest state of India by population, it is contiguous with Uttar Pradesh to its west, Nepal to the north, the northern part of West Bengal to the east, with Jharkhand to the south. The Bihar plain is split by the river Ganges which flows from west to east.Bihar is an amalgamation of three main distinct regions, these are Magadh, Mithila and Bhojpur.
                The name Bihar is derived from 'Vihara' or monastery. The state of Bihar is now divided into two parts, namely Jharkhand and Bihar. Jharkhand is inhabited by the tribes. Patna is the modern capital of Bihar. Bihar is also one of most backward states in India. Bihar is more known as the home of Mahavir and Buddha, where they spent the major part of their life. Some of the most sacred places connected with the life of Buddha are located in Bihar and the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh as Buddha’s travels were confined to these two states. Bihar is also sacred to Buddhists from all over the world who come here for pilgrimage, specially to Bodh Gaya, where the Buddha attained enlightenment. The three major dialects of the people are Maithali prevailing in the east, Magadhi in the south, and Bhojpuri in the west.
 In ancient and classical India, the area that is now Bihar was considered a centre of power, learning, and culture

Bihar is the place that gave birth to Buddhism and Jainism and helped in the growth of Sikhism and Hinduism, has a past that is unmatched anywhere in the world. It was the center of first republic in the world at Vaishali and the city of Pataliputra was largest and grandest in the world at the height of its glory. There is an array of tourist destinations of diverse interests in the state, though their potential has not been exploited fully till now. Starting from the world famous Buddhist Circuit to the Patna Sahib of Patna and Mithila Paintings of Madhubani to silk production center of Bhagalpur, the state has much to offer to the tourists. More than anything else, it is the present image of the state that is not allowing the state to be a frontrunner in attracting tourists.

            <h1>  History</h1>
            <i>
            Bihar has an interesting and glorious past. Bihar's history is dated back to the times of the Ramayana where Sita came from Mithila. Even if e do not treat it as a historical fact but it does make sense that Bihar had a history and civilisation worth mention in the old mythological texts. Bihar has seen great kingdoms and has had a very learned past what with one of India's most ancient university, Nalanda, being located there and the great Buddha having attained knowledge at Bodh Gaya.

            History of Bihar A centre of power, learning and deep-seated culture, Magadha kingdom covering the region of south-west Bihar towered over other empires for well over 1,000 years.

            The Haryanka dynasty (684 B.C.) is the earliest rulers of Magadha. They ruled the kingdom from the then Rajgriha, the present day Rajgir. King Bimbisara and his son Ajatashatru ruled the province during the course of which the latter imprisoned his father to climb the throne.

            Later King Ajatashatru founded Pataliputra (now Patna) that later became the capital of Magadha. Further, he conquered Vajji, north of Ganges with Vaishali as its capital.
                History
Bihar was also the state where Buddhism and Jainism, the two great religions of world were born. It was also the state where both the Buddha and Mahavira lived and preached. In ancient times, Bihar witnessed rise and fall of different empires. Different parts of the state at different times in history were parts of Anga, Videh and Vaishali. Bihar was settled from the west as Aryan tribes moved down the Ganga valley, clearing the forest and developing cultivation. Bihar was the core part of the famous empire of Magadha under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties. The antiquity of Magadha can be seen from the Vedas. The kings of Magadha were so mighty that Alexander the Great decided to retreat from India apprehending defeat. In the closing years of the 4th century B.C., Magadha became a greater power under Maurya and his grandson, Chandragupta. They ruled from the south Bihar from the 4th to 6th centuries BC. The early Magadha kings had their capital at Rajgriha, 100 km south east of Patna. Later they moved their capital to Pataliputra, the site of modern Patna. Pataliputra at that time was as important as Rome in subsequent centuries. The Emperor Ashoka, the great Buddhist emperor, ruled over the entire Indian subcontinent from Patliputra, at that time the capital of India and spread the message of Buddha not only in India but also beyond its shores. It was during Ashoka’s time in the third century B.C. that Buddhism spread to the former Soviet Republics and Afghanistan in the west and Thailand, China, Japan and Indonesia in the east. The Guptas played a central role in the flowering of the Hindu culture of the classical period and regained power for Magadha in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. Various Delhi Sultans and Muslim rulers controlled the region until the Mughals brought it into the territory. When Akbar retook it from the Afghan ruler, the Mughals retained it until the British won the Battle of Buxar in 1764. As a result, Bihar was separated from Bengal and became a province under the British rule until the India's independence in 1947. Today, Bihar has become one of the India's poorest and badly administered state.

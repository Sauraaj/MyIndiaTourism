            Maharashtra, a state spanning west-central India, is best known for its fast-paced capital, Mumbai (formerly Bombay). This sprawling metropolis is the seat of the Bollywood film industry. It also has sites like the British Raj-era Gateway of India monument and cave temples at Elephanta Island. To the south is the rustic, beach-lined Konkan Coast. In the city of Pune, Aga Khan Palace is a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi.
                
                Located in the western part of India, Maharashtra is the third largest state in the country. The state covers an area of 118,809 square miles. Maharashtra shares its borders with the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh , Telangana, Karnataka, Goa and the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. On the western side of the state lies the Arabian Sea.

Divided into thirty six districts, it has cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Solapur, Nagpur, Thane, Jalgaon and Amravati which have a distinct place on the map of the world. All the districts of Maharashtra are grouped into six divisions: Aurangabad Division, Amravati Division, Konkan Division, Nagpur Division, Nashik Division and Pune Division.

The state which is home to one of the largest film industries of the world i.e. Bollywood, also boasts of being the largest contributor to India's national industrial output.
                Maharashtra is one of the most industrialized states of India, it occupies the western and central parts of the country and extends over the Sahyadri mountains; a vast stretch of 720 kilometers of the Arabian sea coast providing it a beautiful backdrop. The present state of Maharashtra was formed on May 1, 1960 on uni-lingual principle by carving it out of the erstwhile Mumbai state, which included the predominantly Marathi-speaking areas as the former princely state of Hyderabad as well as the Central Provinces and Berar.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <i>
            Jorwe in the Ahmadnagar district provide many evidences of ancient civilization in Maharashtra. The Chinese traveler Hiun Tsang, who visited this region in 640-641 BC, was quite appreciative of the prosperity of the region in his writings. During third and fourth centuries BC, the region of Konkan remained under the control of the Mauryans, whose policies led to great advancements in the fields of trade and Buddhist learning in the region. After the disintegration of the Mauryan Empire, the Satwahanas (230 BC - AD 225) came to rule this region. Pratishthan or modern Paithan was their capital. This great empire crumbled because of internal feuds in the ranks of vassals. In succession came the great rulers of the Vakataka, Chalukya, and Rashtrakuta empires making Maharashtra a great center of culture and art.

Yadavas were the last of these kingdoms that lost their power in the early 12th century and a long period of Muslim rule started in Maharashtra. Allauddin Khilji was the first ruler to understand the value of the Deccan as the key to extending influence over south India and consecutive rulers from Delhi till the 17th century tried their best to keep this region under their control. From the middle of the 17th century, a new group of warrior people came to dominate the scene in Maharashtra and elsewhere in India called Marathas.

The origin of Marathas is still debatable, but what is known is that they stole the limelight from the great Mughals. It was only after defeating the Marathas that the English could establish their hegemony on India. Shivaji was the first great ruler of Marathas and it was he who paved the way for future Maratha influence on India. The heroism and greatness of Shivaji is still remembered by the people of this country and his stories are now part of the great Indian folklores.

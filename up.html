<h1>  History</h1>
            <i>The epics of Hinduism, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, were written in Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh also had the glory of being home to Lord Buddha. It has now been established that Gautama Buddha spent most of his life in eastern Uttar Pradesh, wandering from place to place preaching his sermons. The empire of Chandra Gupta Maurya extended nearly over the whole of Uttar Pradesh. Edicts of this period have been found at Allahabad and Varanasi. After the fall of the Mauryas, the present state of Uttar Pradesh was divided into four parts: Surseva, North Panchal, Kosal, and Kaushambi.

The western part of Uttar Pradesh saw the advent of the Shaks in the second century BC. Not much is known of the history of the state during the times of Kanishka and his successors. The Gupta Empire ruled over nearly the whole of Uttar Pradesh, and it was during this time that culture and architecture reached its peak. The decline of the Guptas coincided with the attacks of Huns from Central Asia who succeeded establishing their influence right up to Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh.

The seventh century witnessed the taking over of Kannauj by Harshavardhana. In 1526, Babur laid the foundation of the Mughal dynasty. He defeated Ibrahim Lodi in the battle of Panipat. Babar carried out extensive campaign in various parts of Uttar Pradesh. He defeated the Rajputs near Fatehpur Sikri while his son Humayun conquered Jaunpur and Ghazipur, after having brought the whole of Awadh under his control. After Babur's death (1530), his son Humayun forfeited the empire after being defeated at the hands of Sher Shah Suri at Kannauj.

After the death of Sher Shah Suri in 1545, Humayun once again regained his empire but died soon after. His son Akbar proved to be the greatest of Mughals. His established a unified empire over nearly the whole of the India. During his period, Agra became the capital of India and became heartland of culture and arts. Akbar constructed huge forts in Agra and Allahabad. The period of Jahangir (after 1605) saw arts and culture reach a new high. In 1627, after the death of Jahangir, his son Shahjahan ascended the throne. The period of Shahjahan is known as the golden period of India in art, culture, and architecture. It was during his reign that the classical wonder Taj Mahal was built in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. The régime of Aurangzeb saw the peak of Mughal Empire in terms of geographic expansion.

Modern-day Uttar Pradesh saw the rise of important freedom fighters on the national scenario. Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jawaharlal Nehru, Smt. Indira Gandhi, and Charan Singh were only a few of the important names who played a significant role in India's freedom movement and also rose to become the prime ministers of this great nation.
                
                The antiquity of the state of Uttar Pradesh can be traced back to stone age. Various archaeologists have discovered stone tools like hand axes and choppers in some parts of Uttar Pradesh. By 600 B.C., Uttar Pradesh had a thriving agricultural economy based on money exchange. There were eight well known republics and kingdoms at that time like Kashi, the modern Varanasi; Kosala, the present day Oudh and Vatsa, today’s Allahabad. Uttar Pradesh is also regarded by many Hindus as the birthplace of the Ramayana and Mahabharata. It was the first home of the Vedic religion developed by the earliest lndo-Aryan immigrants from around 1500 BC. In the Vedic period, it formed part of Madhyadesha (Middle Country). It was in Uttar Pradesh that both, the Buddha and Mahavir found their first disciples. Prasenjit, the ruler of Kosala, and Udayan king of Vatsa, were early followers of Lord Buddha. The Buddha preached his first sermon in the deer park at Sarnath and attained parinirvana (spiritual release from the body) at Kushinagar. The origin of Varanasi can be traced back at least a century before the Buddha came to it in 500 BC. It became a great centre of culture, education, commerce and craftsmanship, drawing students and pilgrims from all over the country. Its fame also drew the attention of the rich and powerful kings and its temples and mansions were ransacked on many occasions from the 11th to the 18th centuries. Over two million years ago, Uttar Pradesh was part of Ashoka’s great Mauryan empire. Later most of UP was controlled by various Hindu dynasties until the arrival of the Muslims in the 12th century. The Mughals replaced the early Muslim Sultanates in the 16th century. Agra was one of the capitals of the Mughal Empire which stretched from the Bay of Bengal to Kabul in Afghanistan. Akbar had its capital at Fatehpur Sikri and Agra. The Red Fort, Itmad-ud-Daula and Taj Mahal are some of the famous monuments in Agra. Shah Jahan was responsible for encouraging the development of a fully distinct and uniquely beautiful Mughal architecture and the Taj Mahal is the wonderful example. The arrival of the British in India was followed by their gradual advance up the river Ganga. In 1836, the East India Company possessions in UP and Delhi were combined and known as the North- western provinces. The annexation of the independent province of Oudh in 1856 undoubtedly contributed to the outbreak of the 1857 Indian Mutiny. The first revolt occurred in Meerut and quickly spread to Lucknow, Kanpur, Agra, Allahabad and Jhansi. Some of its most dramatic incidents occurred at Lucknow and Kanpur. After the control of Mutiny by East India Company, the territories were passed to the British. In 1877, the North-western provinces and Oudh were combined to form the united provinces of Agra and Oudh. UP was also in the forefront of the national movement for independence and various incidents associated with the Swaraj (Home Rule) struggle occurred within its boundarie

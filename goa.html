            <h2>History</h2>
            <i>
            
The history of Goa or Gomantak has been woven into seamless mixture of various myths and stories that takes us back into time of Mahabharata. For some the origin of Goa lies when Parshurama; sixth incarnation of Vishnu ordered the sea god Varuna to recede the sea till the point his axe struck after his flung it. Lord Varuna then gave up this piece of land till the banks of River Mandovi and River Zuari to Parshurama and Aryan clan accompanying him. This piece of land came to be known as Konkan of which Goa is a southernmost part of. Another mystical legend is a collection from Krishna’s stories according to which Lord Krishna became fond of the coastal area of Konkan. He then named the area Govapuri (gov: cows) after the cows belonging to the locals.

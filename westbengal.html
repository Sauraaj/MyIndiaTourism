                “Banglar mati, banglar jol”…..West Bengal is one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse states of India. The people of West Bengal inherit their identity and aspiration from the larger Indian mosaic. One can still recapture the colonial era in its relics which survived the state’s progressive development. The land of West Bengal has in it intricately woven stories of many bright mornings and dark nights; stories of many civilisations have left their footprints here. Awash in the memory of that rich history and heritage West Bengal boasts of different ethnicities, cultures, religions, people and languages which add to this beautiful landscape. And that is why Deshbandhu Chittaranjan once said – “There is an eternal truth in the soil of Bengal. ….It is that eternal truth that has been expressed through innumerable changes, evolution and revolutions in Bengal. It is that truth which has proclaimed itself in literature, philosophy, poetry, war, revolution, religion and karma, in ignorance, in unrighteousness, in freedom and in subjection. That is Bengal’s life – Bengal’s soil and Bengal’s water are the external forms of that life.”

                West Bengal aims to become a preferred tourism and tourism-related investment destination by leveraging its unique geographical setting along with its various tourism-related assets. It will develop necessary infrastructure and promote tourism in an integrated manner which will not only bring in more investment and further the socio-economic goals of the Government, but also ensure that all these are in conformity with the relevant acts, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection.

<h1>  History</h1>
            <i>
                Stone Age remnants have been found in Bengal that date back 20,000 years. The indigenous population Bengal consists of tribes and of Austric and Austro-Asiatic origin such as Kola, Bhil, Santhal, Shabara, and Pulinda.

Ancient Bengal:

Bengal is a 4,000 year old civilization that thrived between the banks of Ganges to Brahmaputra and sustained itself with the riches of Gangetic Delta.

Remnants of earliest cities in the state date back to the Vedic Period. The oldest archaeological site in Bangladesh is Mahasthangarh, which dates back to 700 BCE. The culture and ethnicity of Bengal was different than that of the Vedic people. The latter referred to the people of Bengal as 'dasyus' or demon
                Greek traveler and chronicler Megasthenes referred to Bengal as Gangaridai in his book Indica (300 BC). When Alexander invaded India and defeated Porus, he wanted to conquer all of India and moved eastward where he came to know about the mighty forces of the Gangaridai warriors.

Alexander read accounts of Gangetic Delta written by Ptolemy and Diodorus. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (90 BC -30 BC) depicted the Gangaridai warriors in this manner:

"The river is called the Ganges which had a width of thirty two stadia, and a greater depth than any other Indian river. Beyond this again were situated the dominions of the nation of the Prasioi and the Gandaridai, whose king, Xandrammes, had an army of 20,000 horses, 200,000 infantry, 2,000 chariots and 4,000 elephants trained and equipped for war.... Now this (Ganges) river, which is 30 stadia broad, flows from north to south, and empties its water into the ocean forming the eastern boundary of the Gandaridai, a nation which possesses the greatest number of elephants and the largest in size."

Arguably, it was the might of the Gangaridai warriors that made Alexander retreat

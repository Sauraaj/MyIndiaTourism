In its capital, Jaipur (the "Pink City"), are the 18th-century City Palace and Hawa Mahal, a former cloister for royal women, fronted by a 5-story pink-sandstone screen. Amer Fort, atop a nearby hill, was built by a Rajput prince in the early 1600s.

The glory of the state is retained by its majestic palaces, forts and monuments. The vibrant culture and rich heritage of this princely state draw innumerable tourists from across the globe.

                Rajasthan ( Land of Kings) is a place of camels plodding over soft sand dunes of the Thar Desert. It is a state of men with proud mustaches and women with twinkling anklets in colorful swirling ghagras. The landscape is dotted with island palaces shimmering on idyllic blue lakes; temples and fortresses situated on hilltops of the rugged and rocky Aravalli; exquisite palaces built during the reign of some of its many erstwhile Rajput dynasties; and well laid out gardens with pavilions and kiosks, all of which add to the splendor and whimsical charm of this majestic land. However, Rajasthan is not only fort, palaces, and culture. The state is also one place in India, which has marched ahead with its development programs. Problems of the people have remained as the central idea and governance has been put in the hands of the villagers itself. Surely, this state is one destination in India, from where no one can return empty handed.

            <h2>history</h2>
            <i>Rajasthan is home of the valiant Rajputs known for their bravery and chivalry, Rajasthan is said to have been a region where human settlement dated back to the early historical period. Archaeological excavations establish a connection with the Harappan culture, which dates to about 1000BC. In the period from 3000-500BC this region formed a part of the river valley inhabitation. The relics of Virat also speaks of the area being inhabited by the Pre-Aryan people of the oldest called Push Karara Nanya (modern Pushkar in Ajmer).

The first Aryan settlement here was at Dundhmer in modern Dundhar. The influence of Jainism and Buddhism, also spread to this region. It witnessed the rule of the Magadha, Kushanas and the Guptas, during which it was divided into Mahajanapadas and Janapadas. Rajasthan formed part of the Mauryan Empire in about 130-150AD and the Guptas ruled it in the 4th century. From about 640AD the Gujars, Pratiharas, Chauhans, Gahlots etc established their independent Kingdoms.

Internal rivalry between the Rajput Kingdoms led to the establishment of many strong Rajput Kingdoms, which resisted the supreme domination of the Mughals. The Mughal rule declined by about 1707AD and gave way to the Marathas. The Marathas were subdued by the British who disintegrated many of its areas. After Independence Rajasthan was organised into a state in 1956.
